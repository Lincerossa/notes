# 	The whole picture!

I have been using react for almost 1 year and one day I finally saw the **whole picture** (at least from some point of view)!

If you are a dev like me, probably **you know what I mean**!

My learning curve has been anything but linear, and often I felt really stuck, but some weeks ago finally I said a big… **aaaaaaaaaaah, now I get it!**”

Now I try to describe what happened:

1.  The real meaning of Functional Programming:
I have read so many times the difference between FP an OOP, but every definition was so meaningless for me until I got the real meaning of these points:
-> mutations and side effects
-> pure functions
-> declarative vs imperative
-> testability

2. React and its declarative approach
When it comes to using react, it pushes you in the right direction:

  * avoiding side effects 
	* avoid mutations
	* using only one source of thruth
	* avoid imperative approaches
	* using declarative approaches
	* test everything
	* modularity
	* scalability
	* implementing really often the map / reduce / filter / ecc methods of the array (still in the declarative direction)
	
3. Functional programming 
The real meaning of FP is the following one: of **a declarative programming paradigm**.

Functional programming -> Declarative approach -> React 

4. Why should I love react?
After all these points I can say that I love React for many things…. but the most important one, at least for me, is that it helped me to truly understand the real difference between those two program paradigms (fp vs oop)
